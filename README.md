# Hello-World
The very first Git Repository that David made
My name is David Ajibade.
I am an international student studying electrical engineering at Drexel University.
I am a rising junior, a 4th year student based on Drexel's 5-year Co-op program.
My goal in life is to make money work for me and not the other way around.
I hope to help change my home country Nigeria through the knowledge and connections I acquire during my time here.
I will really love to work with a company that will take a chance on me even if I do not have the qualifications.
This is because I acheive whatever I put my mind to. If no one is willing to bet on me, I bet on myself everyday and know that my hardwork will pay off in the end.
I want to start my own media company, thescholarstribune.com which will center on the lives of students and their opinions on life issues.
I want to start a flag football league in Nigeria that will give people an opportunity to use their athletic abilities in a useful way.
I want to build a big school that focuses on building the complete human: Emotionally, Physically, Spiritually and Academically.
I love to play sports like basketball, Football(soccer), Flag Football and any other sport that will allow me use my athleticism.
I am an old soul and love to act as such, so if you see me outside I am probably thinking older than I actually am.
I have joined GitHub because of the course I am taking on Codecademy. I intend to use Codecademy to get the skills I would not have had without a degree. 
Lastly, I just want to be wealthy enough to pay my parents back for all they have done for me; I want to give back as much as I can and ultimately I want to make Heaven after a fulfilling long life.
